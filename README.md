# Landmarkers

Welcome to Landmarkers!


### Main Objective

This web App's main goal is to have a record of all the landmarks (disney's world, Eiffel Tower ..etc..) user's have been. Users are able to leave 'comment'-like type of content on each logs.


Various technologies will be used this web application; Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS(SASS), along with a built API by yours truly! (wunderlust-API). The API was built with Express.js Node.js and deployed on heroku.

## Design details:
This will be a SPA (single page application), it will contain a sign-up/login fornt page along with the main page that will display all logs made. The main page will also have a section to create a new log. Each log will have a feature of updating and deleting the logs.

## Unsolved problems

Not so much as unsolved, more of out of scope and dreaming high.
I would eventually implement the ability to use images.
I would also eventually implement the ability to scout other users logs and comments.



## Web engine

Implementing jQuery/AJAX CRUD.
